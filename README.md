# Flask Blockchain Implementation

This project implements a simple blockchain using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. The blockchain includes features like proof-of-work mining, transaction creation, and a web interface for visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your machine.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The Flask app will start, and you can access it in your browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). Use the web interface to explore the blockchain, mine new blocks, and create transactions.

## Features

- **Mining:** Mine new blocks with proof-of-work.
- **Transactions:** Create transactions and include them in blocks.
- **Web Interface:** Visualize the blockchain and perform transactions through the web interface.
